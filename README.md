🛫 Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict flight delays based on various features such as departure time, day of the week, and weather conditions. The primary objective is to help airlines and passengers anticipate delays, enabling better decision-making and resource management.

🔍 Project Overview
The project uses historical flight data and applies machine learning algorithms to classify flights as either "On Time" or "Delayed". After experimenting with several models, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy. The model has been integrated into a Flask web application for easy interaction and predictions.

📂 Key Features
Predicts flight delays based on historical and weather data.
User-friendly web interface built with Flask for input and results display.
Model trained using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Best performing model saved as a pickle file for deployment.
Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation included.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
Flask (for web deployment)
HTML/CSS (for UI)
GitHub (for version control)
🚀 How to Run the Project Locally
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/flight-delay-prediction.git
Navigate to the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd flight-delay-prediction
Install required dependencies:

📊 Dataset
The dataset used for training the model includes various features like:

Flight number, origin, and destination
Scheduled departure time
Day of the week
Weather conditions (temperature, visibility, wind speed)
The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

🌐 Deployment
This project can be deployed on platforms like Railway, Render, or Fly.io for a free and scalable web service.
