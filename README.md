# 🛫 Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict flight delays based on various features such as departure time, day of the week, and weather conditions. The primary objective is to help airlines and passengers anticipate delays, enabling better decision-making and resource management.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The project uses historical flight data and applies machine learning algorithms to classify flights as either "On Time" or "Delayed". After experimenting with several models, **Logistic Regression** achieved the highest accuracy. The model has been integrated into a **Flask web application** for easy interaction and predictions.
